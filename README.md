# etch-a-sketch
Hello! This browser version of the sketchpad toy called Etch A Sketch 
was made using mostly JavaScript and CSS. I made this project in order
to showcase my JavaScript and CSS skills. After the user chooses how 
many squares should be rendered inside the main container he has the 
freedom to draw whatever he desires by hovering over the squares.

This is Project: Etch-A-Sketch from The Odin Project https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch

What I learned:
- How to create square divs using JavaScript
- How to edit the square divs as a grid using CSS
- How to properly use CSS in order to add effects
to certain elements like hovering or rotating
- How to briefly use Sass (SCSS) in order to generate
a random color for each square div
